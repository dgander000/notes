# Week 1 - Introduction to Data   

## What is statistics?  
- Methodological subject encompassing all aspects of learning from data
- Tools and methods for working with and understanding data
- Statistic
    - Numerical or graphical summary of a collection of data
    - Average
    - Minimum
    - Proportion
- Statistics
    - Academic discipline focusing on research methodology
- Many perspectives
    - Art of summarizing data
    - Science of uncertainty
    - Science of decisions
    - Science of variation
    - Art of forecasting
    - Science of measurement
    - Basis for principled data collection

## What is data?
- Numbers
- Images
- Words/Text
- Audio/Sound

## Where does data come from?
- Two key types of data
    - Organic/Process data
        - Financial, stock market, viewing history, browser activity, sports, temperature, pollution
        - "Big Data"
        - Data scientists "mine" this data to learn trends and find interesting relationships
    - "Designed" data collection
        - Studies, polls
        - Individuals sampled from a population and asked opinions on a subject
        - Design a sample or subset
        - Gennerally smaller datasets
        - Collected for specific needs

## Is the data i.i.d.?
- When analyzing data, regardless of source, it's important to know if the data i.i.d.
- i = independent and id = identically distributed
- No correlation/dependencies between measurements
- All the observations are independent of all the other observations
- All the values arise from some common statistical distribution
- Can estimate the features of that distribution with a certain amount of precision assuming the data is i.i.d
- Need different analytical procedures for non iid data
    
## Variable types
- Quantitative variablea
    - Numerical, measurable quantity
        - Arithmetic operations often make sense
        - Continuous - could take any value within an interval
        - Discrete - finite number of values
- Categorical (Qualitative) variables
    - Classifies individuals or items into different groups
    - Ordinal - groups have an order or ranking
    - Nominal - groups are merely names, no ranking

## Study design
- Types of research studies
    - Exploratory vs Confirmatory studies
    - Comparative vs Non-Comparative studies
    - Observational studies vs Experiments
- Confirmatory
    - Scientific method
    - Specify falsifiable hypothesis
    - test it -> collect data
- Exploratory
    - Collect and analyze data without first pre-specifying question
- Non-Comparative Research Studies
    - Focus on estimating or predicting absolute quantities
