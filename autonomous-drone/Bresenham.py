# Your task is to implement the bresenham function given two points $p_1$ and $p_2$ as inputs. The function should return the list of grid cells required to draw the line.
# 
# What conditions would warrant a move by 1 unit along the x-axis? What about along the y-axis?
# 
# The idea is to move based on whether the next $y$ value will be above or below the line from $p_1$ to $p_2$. We can keep track of the current line value, effectively $f(x)$ where $f$ is the line equation by incrementing a counter variable by the slope $m$ whenever we move in the x-axis.
# 
# The condition is then (in pseudocode):
# 
# ```
# if f(x+1) > y + 1:
#     y += 1
# else:
#     x += 1
# ```
# 
# So, if moving along the y-axis results in a y value that is below the line, then move along the y-axis, otherwise,  move in the x-axis.
# 
# But what about the case where `f(x+1) == y+1`? This will be the result of every test case when the line slope `m = 1`. In this case you have a choice to make:
# * Only identify cells that as "in collision" when the line actually passes through those cells (less conservative obstacle avoidance)
# * When the line passes directly through a corner of grid cells, identify all cells that share that corner as "in collision" (more conservative obstacle avoidance). 
# 
# These two options look like this for a line from (0, 0) to (5, 5):
# 
# ![comparison](./bresenham_comparison.png)
# 
# Try coding up both! In the event that you've padded obstacles  in your grid map with a sufficient safety margin, you can likely get away with the less conservative approach (or computer graphics based Bresenham implementation in the Python package shown below).
