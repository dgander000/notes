# ## Confguration Space
# 
# In this notebook you'll create a configuration space given a map of the world and setting a particular altitude for your drone. You'll read in a `.csv` file containing obstacle data which consists of six columns $x$, $y$, $z$ and $\delta x$, $\delta y$, $\delta z$.
# 
# You can look at the `.csv` file [here](/edit/colliders.csv). The first line gives the map center coordinates and the file is arranged such that:
# 
# * $x$ -> NORTH
# * $y$ -> EAST
# * $z$ -> ALTITUDE (+)
# 
# Each $(x, y, z)$ coordinate is the center of the obstacle. $\delta x$, $\delta y$, $\delta z$ are the half widths of the obstacles, meaning for example that an obstacle with $(x = 37, y = 12, z = 8)$ and $(\delta x = 5, \delta y = 5, \delta z = 8)$ is a 10 x 10 m obstacle that is 16 m high and centered at the point $(37, 12, 8)$.
# 
# Given a map like this, the free space in the $(x, y)$ plane is a function of altitude, and you can plan a path around an obstacle, or simply fly over it! You'll extend each obstacle by a safety margin to create the equivalent of a 3 dimensional configuration space. Your task is to extract a 2D map of your configuration space for a particular altitude, where each value is assigned either a 0 or 1 representing feasible or infeasible (obstacle) spaces respectively.

# The end result should look something like this ... (colours aren't important)
