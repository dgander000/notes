# https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity gives a solid overview of Python data structures and their time complexity.

# * [`Enum`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#module-enum) is used to represent possible actions on the grid.
# * A [`PriorityQueue`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html#queue.PriorityQueue) is used in order to prioritize expanding nodes with lower cost. The naive approach would take `O(n)` time since we would scan the entire queue to determine the position of the item. A `PriorityQueue` allows this insertion to be done in `O(log(n))` time instead.
